Description: The package is a compilation of Canadian food composition data. 
   Information is derived from the comprehensive United States Department of Agriculture, 
   excluding those foods not available in the Canadian market. The relational database 
   includes information on the foods available, the nutrients they have and their 
   amounts, how much of the food is useful (yield) and how much is waste (refuse) 
   including details on what these yields or refuses correspond to (fat, bone, etc.), 
   and mainly what food group these foods are part of. Info on where each record of 
   data came from is also provided, as well as conversion factors to use to find 
   nutrient amounts for common household portion weights for the foods. All 
   measurements use the metric system.
